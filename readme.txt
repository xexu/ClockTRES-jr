#ClockTRES jr.

is a ClockTHREE jr. [WyoLum Team] software clone.

It is plain HTML/CSS3/JS using jQuery so you don't need a webserver to run it.

You are free to use, embed, modify and distribute it as long as you keep some credits.

Notes:
-The original layout is the following:

KITRISCTENHALFX.
QUARTERTWENTYBZ.
IFIVECMINUTESAL.
PASTOBTWONEIGHTS
THREELEVENSIXTEN
FOURFIVESEVENINE
TWELVEXOCLOCKYAM
PMYDMTHWMFSUALR!

While I am using this one:
